The overall design takes inspiration from
vintage Bollywood posters, 
especially the hand-painted hoardings. 
Slightly orangissh colors and illustrative elements to 
  
recreate that nostalgic cinema feel.
The typography is kept bold and heavy , espcially in middle for the word " SHREYA " to highlight main focus of the show.
I used static colors and big elements best for instagram, so that viewer sttention is grabbed instantly
Used the big and bright EfferVescence logo at top to clearly show the brand.
