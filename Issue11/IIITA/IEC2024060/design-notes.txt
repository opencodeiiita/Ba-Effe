Artist Choice:
SANAM was selected because their retro-pop and acoustic style aligns with Rangara’s
vintage Bollywood theme. Their music evokes nostalgia while still feeling modern.

Design Concept:
The poster uses a dark cinematic background inspired by 70s–80s Bollywood film posters.
A spotlight composition places the artist as a guest star while keeping Effervescence
as the main identity.

Layout System:
A single 1080x1080 master layout was created and adapted to Instagram Story and Print
formats by scaling and repositioning, ensuring consistency across all platforms.
