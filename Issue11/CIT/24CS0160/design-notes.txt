Artist Choice:
    Ravi Raaj was chosen as the artist to highlight emerging talent while keeping the focus on 
Effervescence as the main attraction. Featuring an artist with a strong live-performance presence 
aligns with the fest’s aim of celebrating music, culture, and youthful energy.

Design Decisions:
    The design follows a vintage Bollywood premiere poster style, using bold typography, structured 
text hierarchy, and classic layout techniques. The artist name is prominently displayed, similar 
to retro film posters, while Effervescence remains central as the “main event.” Clean alignment, 
clear event details, and subtle retro aesthetics ensure the poster feels festive, cinematic, and 
easy to read, maintaining Effervescence’s cultural identity without overpowering it.
