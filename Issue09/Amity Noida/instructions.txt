Introduce subtle Retro India-inspired elements that enhance the visual appeal without overpowering the existing design.
Apply a light vintage paper texture in the background to create warmth and an understated nostalgic feel.
Add mandala or traditional ornamental motifs in the corners, using very low opacity so they remain decorative and non-distracting.
Replace stark white areas with soft cream tones, complemented by muted saffron accents for an authentic yet refined Indian aesthetic.
Ensure the layout, content structure, typography, and brand identity remain exactly the same, with no alterations to spacing or hierarchy.
Overall look should feel elegant, timeless, and culturally inspired, not bold or festive.
