Effervescence – Design Notes

The logo represents energy, celebration, and creative expression. A flowing, cursive wordmark conveys rhythm and continuity, reflecting the dynamic spirit of the cultural fest.

A vibrant multi-color gradient symbolizes diversity, inclusivity, and joy, while supporting elements like dance, music, drama masks, and fireworks highlight the festival’s artistic core.

Both dark and light mode versions ensure versatility across digital and print media. The central composition keeps the logo bold, scalable, and timeless for long-term use.
