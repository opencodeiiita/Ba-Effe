The design draws inspiration from classic Sholay-era film posters, using a bold, condensed typeface to create a cinematic and authoritative presence suitable for a flagship cultural fest. The typography is kept strong and legible, ensuring the title feels iconic and memorable.
Visual elements like the vintage film camera and clapperboard directly reference cinema, reinforcing the theme while grounding the identity in storytelling and performance. The human figure adds movement and celebration, representing the energetic, expressive spirit of Effervescence.
A warm, earthy colour palette evokes retro poster aesthetics while remaining refined and uncluttered. The layout balances text and imagery with ample negative space, keeping the composition classy, readable, and scalable across posters, banners, and digital media.
Overall, the design blends retro cinematic influence with modern clarity, capturing both nostalgia and fest vibrancy in a clean, recognizable identity
